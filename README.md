This repo includes examples of exercises to practice basic concepts when working with normal probability distributions. This is in preparation for the ColumbiaX CSMM.102x Machine Learning Course.

- **Normal distribution** given *variate* (x), *mean* (mu) and *variance* (sd): **main.py**
- Probability of **birthdays not coinciding** in a class of n students: **birthdays.py**
- **Dices** probability that sum of two dices equals a specific value: **dices.py**
